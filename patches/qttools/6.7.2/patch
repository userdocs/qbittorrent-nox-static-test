Subject: [PATCH] CMake: Re-enable lupdate/lconvert/lrelease in no-gui builds

This reverts 8dba0e48a0f7d3487b318a74f80f2d8e59c320f9 which disabled the
'linguist' feature if the 'printsupport' feature wasn't available.
However, the 'linguist' feature controls not only the Qt Linguist
application but also the command line tools lupdate, lconvert, and
lrelease. In no-gui builds, which also disable printsupport, the command
line tools were unexpectedly missing.

Fix the issue by extending the feature condition in
src/linguist/CMakeLists.txt. As drive-by, fix the FEATURE_png condition
that was still in QMake form from the initial conversion.

Fixes: QTBUG-126189
Task-number: QTBUG-125066
